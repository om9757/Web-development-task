    <h2>Reduce Waste at the Source</h2>

    <p>
        One of the easiest ways to protect New Zealand’s oceans is by cutting down on plastic waste. Single-use plastics like bags, bottles, and food wrappers often end up in waterways and eventually the sea. By choosing reusable items—like cloth bags, metal drink bottles, and containers—we can reduce the amount of rubbish that pollutes our environment. Recycling properly and avoiding products with excessive packaging also helps keep our oceans clean and safe for marine life.

    <h3>Keep Boats and Beaches Clean</h3>

    <p>
        Boats and beaches are popular in New Zealand, but they can become sources of pollution if not cared for properly. Boaters should avoid dumping waste, oil, or sewage into the water, and always secure rubbish until it can be disposed of on land. Beachgoers can help by picking up litter, using bins, and joining local clean-up events. These small actions make a big difference in keeping our coastlines beautiful and protecting sea creatures from harm.

    <h4>Support Marine Protected Areas</h4>

    <p>
        New Zealand’s ocean is home to rare and beautiful marine species, but many are at risk due to pollution and overfishing. Marine protected areas (MPAs) give ecosystems a chance to recover and thrive by limiting harmful activities. Supporting MPAs—through donations, volunteering, or simply learning more—helps ensure that future generations can enjoy healthy oceans. The more we protect these areas, the stronger our marine life and coastal communities will be.
