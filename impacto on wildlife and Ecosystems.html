    <h1> Impact on Wildlife and Ecosystems</h1>

    <h2> Harm to Marine Animals</h2>

    <p>
        Plastic pollution causes serious injuries to sea creatures. Turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish and eat them, which can block their stomachs and lead to death. Dolphins, seals, and whales can get trapped in old fishing nets, making it hard for them to swim or find food.

    <h3>Damage to Ecosystems</h3>

    <p>
        Pollution affects entire ocean ecosystems. Chemicals from factories and farms can poison coral reefs and kill plankton, which are the base of the food chain. When these small organisms die, it affects all the animals that rely on them for food
    </p>

    <h4>Microplastics in the Food Chain</h4>

    <p>
        Tiny plastic pieces called microplastics are now found in fish, shellfish, and even plankton. These plastics can carry harmful chemicals and enter the bodies of animals—and eventually humans—through the food we eat.
